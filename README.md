# Imagine

Imagine the world where you call pull in a new version of some Open Source library and not worry if it breaks compatibility.
Imagine that you can submit a pull request to some project, have it reviewed timely, and have the new version with your fix available to you in minutes after your PR is merged.
Imagine that for any dependency you consider upgrading, you can view its neatly and consistently maintained release notes.
Imagine that you can set up practical Continuous Delivery automation in your project in minutes, by using a well behaving and documented Gradle plugin.
Imagine that you can focus on code and features while the release management, versioning, publishing, release notes generation is taken care for you automagically.

This is the goal of [Shipkit](https://github.com/mockito/shipkit) project. The project started in November 2016 and is currently in progress.

"Shipkit Example" is a practical example use of [Shipkit](https://github.com/mockito/shipkit).
